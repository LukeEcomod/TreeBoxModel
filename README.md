# TreeBoxModel

Simple tree model for xylem and phloem sap flux calculations following 
[Hölttä et. al., (2006)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00468-005-0014-6)
and [Nikinmaa et. al., (2014)](https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/114/4/653/2769025)

The root uptake is modelled according to [Volpe et. al., (2013)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170813001231)

The gas transport module is based on [Hölttä and Kolari (2009)](https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/29/11/1447/1650165) and stem gas transport model by [Jani Anttila](https://github.com/janivaltteri/stem-gas-transport).
